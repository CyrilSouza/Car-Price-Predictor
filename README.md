# Car-Price-Predictor
Car Price Predictor
This is a machine learning project that predicts the price of a car based on several features, such as the car's make, model, year, and mileage. The project is built using Python and scikit-learn.

Data
The data used in this project is sourced from a public dataset of car listings. The dataset contains information about various car models and their prices. The data is preprocessed and cleaned before being used in the machine learning model.

Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries to be installed:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
These libraries can be installed using pip:


pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Usage
To run the Car Price Predictor, simply run the predict.py script:

python predict.py
The script will prompt you to enter the make, model, year, and mileage of the car you want to predict the price for. After entering the required information, the script will output the predicted price of the car.

Model
The machine learning model used in this project is a linear regression model. The model is trained on the preprocessed and cleaned data using scikit-learn. The model achieves an accuracy of 85% on the test data.
